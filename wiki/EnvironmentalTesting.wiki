#summary Testing the router in different environments
#labels Phase-QA

Testing the router in different DNS environments is critical to ensuring reliability.  The environment is defined by the presence and configuration of four different records:

  * NAPTR
  * SRV
  * A
  * AAAA

Of the above, A and AAAA have equivalent meaning, since the results are grouped.

= NAPTR =

Routing results are affected by the _order_ and _preference_ of NAPTR records.

= SRV =

Routing results are affected by the _priority_ and _weight_ of SRV records.
