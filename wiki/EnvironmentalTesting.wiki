#summary Testing the router in different environments
#labels Phase-QA

Testing the router in different DNS environments is critical to ensuring reliability.  The environment is defined by the presence and configuration of four different records:

  * NAPTR
  * SRV
  * A
  * AAAA

Of the above, A and AAAA have equivalent meaning, since the results are grouped.

= NAPTR =

Routing results are affected by the _order_ and _preference_ of NAPTR records.

= SRV =

{{{
_sip._tcp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 0 5 5060 sipserver.example.com.
_sip._udp.example.com. 86400 IN SRV 0 5 5060 sipserver.example.com.
}}}

Routing results are sorted by the _priority_, then _weight_ of SRV records.  In accordance with 3263, we sort SRV records by the _target_ field too.
