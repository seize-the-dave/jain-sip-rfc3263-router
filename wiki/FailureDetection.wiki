#summary Discussion about detecting hop failure
#labels Phase-Design

Add a `SipListener` to each `SipProvider` in the `SipStack`.  

Record the `Hop` selected for a particular `Request`.  If the `SipListener` observes a `TransactionTerminated` event, the `Hop` should be marked as "good".  If the `SipListener` observes a `TimeoutEvent` or `IOExceptionEvent`, the `Hop` should be marked as "bad".
