This page contains details of the testing requirements for this project

== Test Requirements from RFC 3261 (SIP) ==

3261 tests only the behaviour of the javax.sip.address.Router.

== Test Requirements from RFC 3263 (Locating SIP Servers) ==

4. Client Usage

  * Support for stateless proxies is absent, as Locator orders records according to 2782.
  * Router does not support Server Usage

== Test Requirements from RFC 2782 (DNS SRV) ==

Usage rules

== Test Requirements from RFC 2915 (DNS NAPTR) ==

4. The Basic NAPTR Algorithm

  * Ordering by order field
  * Ordering by preference field
  * Flags: MUST be "s"
  * Regexp: MUST be empty.

The resource record will contain an empty regular expression and a replacement value, which is the SRV record for that particular transport protocol.

SRV record means flags must be "s".
