#summary Things to test
#labels Phase-QA

This page is used as a notice board for recording test strategies.  RFC 3263 provides a large number of variables to incorporate in testing.

= Environmental Variables =

We should test combinations of the presence of the various DNS records, e.g.

  * NAPTR
  * SRV
  * A and AAAA

It would seem illegal for a DNS server to not chain its records correctly, but it is possible through misconfiguration.  For example, if the DNS server has an NAPTR record, we would expect to see a corresponding SRV record.  Likewise, if the DNS server has a SRV record, we would expect to see a corresponding A or AAAA record.

= Local Variables =

  * maddr
     * host
  * Route (3261)
  * sip: / sips:
  * host 
     * hostname
     * IPv4address
     * IPv6reference
  * port
  * transport parameter
    * tcp
    * udp
    * sctp

= maddr =

RFC 3261, Section 18.1.1

 A client that sends a request to a multicast address MUST add the "maddr" parameter to its Via header field value containing the destination multicast address, and for IPv4, SHOULD add the "ttl" parameter with a value of 1.  Usage of IPv6 multicast is not defined in this specification, and will be a subject of future standardization when the need arises.

Does this mean that if the maddr parameter is present, that the transport must be UDP?  It *should* be UDP, but can be abused.
